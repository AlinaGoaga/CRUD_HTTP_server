# CRUD_HTTP_server - WIP 

Simple REST API to retrieve, add and delete books. Data is managed in the app via variables (rather than interacting with a database).

This requires the instalation of gorilla/mux: `go get -u github.com/gorilla/mux`

To run the app: `go run main.go` 

To run the tests: `go test -v`
